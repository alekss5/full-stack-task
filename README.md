This is my basic implementation for the time that i had. All CRUD operations work.<br><br>
I didn't create a .env file and left my mongodb link so you can test the app (hope there is no IP address permisions with the mongodb).

After downloading the project just run in the backend and fronted folder:

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
